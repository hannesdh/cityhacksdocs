# Screening students

## What do we screen our students for?

* We need students to be eager to learn!
* Students need a well-formulated CV and motivational letter.
* Portfolio's, githubs, writing pieces or some show-cases are important. If they lack this information, it's a bad sign — but you can give them a call to make sure they send some information over.
* Students must be able to express themselves in English, and understand others well. If their CV is not written in English, or you're not sure how fluent they are; you can give that student a call.
  * To find out if you can have a decent conversation with a student, ask them about their experience, motivation and why they want to join.
* If there's something else that's wrong, or if you're not sure, give them a call and ask some questions. Conduct the interview in English.

## Judging their skill-level and experience

* Experience:
  * First-year students are usually not experienced enough to join Open Summer of Code. Their portfolio has to stand out a lot to make up for the lack of experience \(working in teams, complex assignments, dealing with clients\).
  * Make sure that second-year students succeeded their first year — zoom in on their portfolio, motivation and attitude. Some work that is not related to school is a huge plus.
  * Third-year students can take on some responsibility, which is nice. Zoom in on attitude and motivation! Their portfolio should be extended.

## Screening process

There are three types:

* Yes
* Maybe
* No

More information to be added soon.

## Side notes

* We do not negotiate price. It's not about money.
