# The Coaching Job

> It’s rewarding to see I could actually help the students, and see them grow by my guidance.  
>   
> I loved exploring new tech, together with the students, and learning more about it. Getting to know all these talented students motivated me as well. It’s a wonderful network to be in. It was a wonderful experience to see I could actually help the students in a good way, and to see how much they learn in such a short amount of time.

## What will I be doing?

As coach you will be guiding a diverse team of students through the project development process. Your students have different skills and expertise, and each project is different. **Your role is to facilitate interaction within your team and between your team and partners**

* Have discussions with your project partner to establish a clear vision of the specific open innovation project.
* You will endorse the desired student roles \(web development, design, business or communication\) essential to turning the partners idea into real-world products and services.
* You'll outline a plan for action to facilitate students' progress throughout the one-month project. You'll be providing structure and guidance for the students to help them flourish and do a good job.
* In the end, your team will present the finished product to the partnering organisation and the wide public.

Experience in coaching and team-coordination are not required but considered an asset. What counts most is a positive mindset and the motivation to have an awesome summer!

Every coach has their own style. You're free to experiment — as long as you're motivating students to do their best, and keeping your client happy.
