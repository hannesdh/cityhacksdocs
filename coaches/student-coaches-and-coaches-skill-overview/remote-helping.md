![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-17.07.16.png)

As a coach, whenever you have some time off â€“ AKA letting your students go ðŸ”¥, you can make yourself to help out students by clicking the hand emoji in the help channel \#start-consulting.

{% hint style="info" %}
Aim to be available to people outside of your team approximately for one hour a day \(fulltime coaches\) or half an hour a day \(halftime coaches\).
{% endhint %}

## Students Can Now Actively Reach Out

Whenever a someone types "@consulting" in one of the help channels, while you set yourself on available, you get a notification. If you can help out, you can just react on that message!
