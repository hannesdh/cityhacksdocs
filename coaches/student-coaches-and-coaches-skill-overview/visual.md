> _I am a graduate Devine and Multimedia and Communication Technology student. I’m a creative developer but I also have a passion for design that is visually pleasing and intuitive. Throughout the years, I've learned a lot from motion graphics to UX/UI till front-end development and in the last year a little bit of back-end. I like to get a taste of everything! My life and work have always been inspired by my admiration for purity, minimalism and a dash of humour. Inspired by fashion, product design and technology. What I like the most is the ability to create something unique, narrative and amazing and how it continues to grow year after year._
