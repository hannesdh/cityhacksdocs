# Salary & Reimbursements

## Pay

**Belgium**  
You'll be making €40 an hour — but you'll be getting so much more!

**Spain**  
Because we're still in an early phase, you'll be volunteering for now — as you're investing in a future!

## Personal expenses

We compensate all your public transports costs. You are free to come by car or book yourself a fancy hotel, but we don't reimburse those things.

## Team expenses

There's a budget for each team every year, so you can dress up your booth at the demo day every year. We'll communicate about it at the start of Osoc.
