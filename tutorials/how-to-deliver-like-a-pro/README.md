# Deliver Like a Pro

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.26.27.png)

You and your other team members will create a lot of valuable things for the client in these 4 weeks. It's important that they get to see it, use and reuse it \(we are _open_!\).

That's why you, as a student, are responsible to make sure you gather and communicate about this!

## Most important

### 1. Make sure you ship something.

Make it something you'll be proud of, and you can show off in your portfolio üòé

![Showing something that works on the demo day is key.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.27.13.png)

### 2. Make sure your client can find & reuse that ship.

Gather everything, document it well and make sure they can find out about where to find everything \(in the team's deliverables folder\) via a handover email at the end of osoc.

![It can only work when it&#x2019;s well-documented, and when the vision is crystal-clear.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.27.23.png)

### 3. Make the ship discoverable & traceable for interested audiences.

Make sure your project can survive on the internet, and you can refer to it in your portfolio. A link that can won't suddenly be taken down, like for instance on [Github Pages](publishing-a-github-page.md), will help you here.

### 4. Support future teams by giving them the 411 in advance.

![Good documentation, assets &amp; guidance help future teams.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.27.37.png)

Giving someone the 411 means you give them all context and updates they need to hit the ground running; to make sure that they are as informed as possible. It definitely is possible your project returns next year.

So if you are working on a project that has been around the year before, make sure you get your hands on that information!

## The checklist

![We created a&#x2028;deliverable checklist &#x2028;to help teams accomplish these steps.&#x2028;](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.31.43.png)

Step 1: Go to the drive **folder for students** [**https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4SAYpis-DJbNmb5zPcaw6bjP-aQEFRm?usp=sharing**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4SAYpis-DJbNmb5zPcaw6bjP-aQEFRm?usp=sharing)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="info" %}
We have changed from Nextcloud to **Drive** because of editing issues. Sorry for the inconvenience!
{% endhint %}

## Some help

![There are some templates, examples &amp; guidelines to help you out.](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.41.46.png)

### The Handover Dossier

**Gather all the knowledge of the team‚Äôs project in this dossier.**  
This will help the client understand what kind ship the team has built, how they got to that ship, and where to find everything.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.41.05.png)

* Find the template in your team folder [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4SAYpis-DJbNmb5zPcaw6bjP-aQEFRm?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4SAYpis-DJbNmb5zPcaw6bjP-aQEFRm?usp=sharing)
* Find examples of the handover dossier here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16z6e39rb6t7AAgYl0InFLsG09o8BI3BC?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16z6e39rb6t7AAgYl0InFLsG09o8BI3BC?usp=sharing)

### Github Pages

**The internet is volatile. Things disappear. Your effort should not.**  
We want to make sure the project remains findable & traceable even after it‚Äôs removed from its domain name, and is still legible by people that don't want to dive in the code.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-06-30-at-22.55.58.png)

* Find out how to [create a Github page](publishing-a-github-page.md)
* Get access to a [template](publishing-a-github-page.md#picking-a-template) \[[example](https://osoc20.github.io/gh-pages/)\]

### The Other Deliverables

**Contacting press, user tests, ..**  
Not everything has a guide. But we have many coaches, student coaches and even students to help out. Get in touch!

### The Handover Email

Write a clear, professional email with a link to your deliverables at the end of open summer of code \([see calendar](../../programma-remote-edition/week-4-deliver/day-3.md)\) ‚Äì and a kind goodbye.

### We use the last week to get it done

**Yes, it‚Äôs a lot. This is why we have the last week available to do that.**  
our team is not just to ‚Äúcode‚Äù, ‚Äúwrite‚Äù, ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. They are here to learn to see the bigger picture, create a project, to grow. It‚Äôll help them do that!
