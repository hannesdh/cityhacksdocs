## 60 seconds

You have 60 seconds to deliver a crystal clear message to your audience.

## Maximum 6 slides

Optional for hackathon!

## What needs to be in there

* The team \(yourself, your team members, your coach\(es\) – short!
* The client \(who is it\)
* The project

## Music

Do not just grab any music – copyright may be applied, and you would have to pay for it ;-\). Open source is the way to go! Ask for ideas and resources on Discord.
