# Practical: When, where, how long, food, sick days, ...

## When & Where

In the month of July, from Monday through Thursday from 09:00 to 17:00 you'll be expected, fresh & clean, at the \(home\) office for that day.

You can find the location and calendar on your the website for your country's edition.

## How many days will I work?

We hire students that are eligible to work under a student contract for 16 full days \(128 hours\).

## Food

Remote edition: We encourage you to take breaks and eat healthy \(when you can\)!

In real life edition: Bring your own sandwiches or get a snack on the road to fill your tummies with; there will be shops in the neighbourhood!

## What do I do when I'm ill?

It happens to the best of us. First of all, inform your coach\(es\). The coach will make sure the word is out. Once you've recovered, please bring a sick note to your coach.

## I really really really have to attend something...

Sometimes there are things more important than Open summer of code \(yes, we find that hard to believe as well!\). Please inform the organisation up front. We'll work something out. But we don't want your team to miss out on you for too long â€” we've selected you for a reason, and we need you!

## Can we work remote?

The 2020 edition is fully remote! Occasional \(and fully optional\) gatherings with small groups can occur.
