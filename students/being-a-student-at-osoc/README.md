# Being a student at osoc

## Why should I participate?

There are multiple reasons to participate. First of all, you can improve your skills under the supervision of several experienced coaches. Secondly, since you’ll be making a real product or service, it looks great on your resume and you’ll expand your network. Thirdly, you’ll surely make some new friends too. Sounds awesome, no?
