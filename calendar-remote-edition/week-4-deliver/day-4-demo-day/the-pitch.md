# Extra Pitch and Interview Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Reduce noise 📣**  
Make sure you're in a space with little background noise or echo. Sitting in a closet or cupboard sometimes helps 😅

**Reduce distraction** 💃  
Create an environment that focuses on you: sit yourself in a space with a _"clean"_  background behind you. Just make sure it isn't distracting.

**Light your face 🙍🏽‍♀️🔦☀️**  
Make sure we can see your face well. Light your face; not your back – always face windows & lights.

**Look at us** 👀  
Look in the camera, so it feels like you're looking at us!

**Use a good mic 🎙**  
Use a good microphone, that is preferably not your laptop's microphone.  
- option A, for **pre-recorded videos**: Connect your phone as a mic \(you can connect your video too!\), and keep it close to you; as if you're talking to someone on videochat. Try out different positions to avoid "pops" in your voice.  
- option B, for **live videos**: use the microphone of your earbuds or headphones. Try all of them! It'll work better than your laptop's mic, as it is closer to your mouth.

_Make sure you look "in the screen", into empty space next to you, not outside of the video._
