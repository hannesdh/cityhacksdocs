# Projects

## Execution

You have a clear idea in mind about the end result and the end user of the application. In that case the students will get the ball rolling during oSoc.

## Proof of concept 

You have pretty solid idea, but it still requires some finetuning. You might be uncertain about the feasibility of a certain idea, concept or solution. In this case the students can provide some clarity by providing a new proof of concept. The students will exercise some creative freedom and will spend some time ideating.

## Surprise us

No specific guidelines or preferences? You might want the \#oSoc experience, but youâ€™re not sure about the expected end result. You're at the right address. Let the students surprise you with their creativity, enthusiasm and skills! The students will take it from here.
