How to deliver like a pro \[[tutorial](../../../tutorials/how-to-deliver-like-a-pro/)\]!

## 11:00 \[coaches only\] Coach retro

We would love to hear your feedback. If you really can't make it, we'll send the questions afterwards.

We meet via Zoom â€“ as Discord cannot support sufficient people and some coaches cannot join Jitsi.
