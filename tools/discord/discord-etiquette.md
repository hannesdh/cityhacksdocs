# Discord etiquette

### Add a picture of yourself

During a remote edition, a picture does a lot! To help get to know and recognize each other, we suggest you [add a picture of yourself](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204156688-How-do-I-change-my-avatar-?page=1). 

If you're already using Discord to engage with other communities, but would rather not have your picture in them, you can make an account for osoc specifically.



### Set your nickname to your full name

This makes you easier to recognize, and makes things a little more personal. [You can set different nicknames for different servers](https://help.osoc.be/global/tools/discord/setting-your-nickname) specifically, so this information stays within the osoc server.



### Post in the right channels

Most channels describe what they're for. Post everything related to your specific project in its channel.

### Keep things "safe for work"

As mentioned in the [Code of Conduct](https://help.osoc.be/global/students/the-student-job/code-of-conduct), messages & content that contain violence, hate, racism, nudity, pornography, profanity, gore, or anything else considered unwelcome in a work environment, have no place in the osoc communication channels.



### Use @ mentions sparingly

Most people have notifications for mentions on. If something isn't urgent or you're not replying to someone's message, use @ sparingly. Discord tends to be open during work, and unnecessary notifications will distract from working flow.



### Mute your microphone when you're not speaking

When in a voice channel - mute your microphone when you're not actively talking. This helps reduce background noises from fans, busy streets, and excited family members or roommates :\). 

You can also [enable push to talk](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/211376518-Voice-Input-Modes-101-Push-to-Talk-Voice-Activated-?page=2), which makes sure your microphone is only activated when you press a key.
